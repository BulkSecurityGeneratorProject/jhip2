protractor can be run with the modified gruntfile as grunt e2e

the configuration for grunt was a pain in the butt. See the selenium and chromedriver specification in the conf.js file in this directory. This is NOT portable. 

A better set of e2e tests: 
-- add a case. add a child associated with the case. go to maintain and see the child and the case info
